## What is OpenTelemetry Weaver?

OpenTelemetry Weaver is a tool for managing OpenTelemetry schemas and generating code from them. The Bazel rules provide:

- **Hermetic Builds**: All dependencies are properly declared for reproducible builds
- **Remote Execution Support**: Optimized for Bazel remote execution
- **Cross-Platform**: Support for Linux, macOS, and Windows
- **Schema Management**: Declare, validate, and manage schema files
- **Code Generation**: Generate type-safe code from schemas
- **Policy Validation**: Validate schemas against policies
- **Toolchain Integration**: Seamless integration with Bazel's toolchain system

## Key Features

### üîí Hermetic & Reproducible
- All dependencies are explicitly declared
- SHA256 verification for downloaded binaries
- Platform-specific binary selection
- No external dependencies during build

### üöÄ Remote Execution Optimized
- Efficient binary downloads
- Minimal network transfers
- Platform detection for remote workers
- Optimized for distributed builds

### üõ†Ô∏è Developer Friendly
- Simple rule definitions
- Comprehensive error messages
- Integration with existing Bazel workflows
- Extensive documentation and examples

### üîß Flexible Configuration
- Custom download URLs
- Platform-specific overrides
- Environment variable support
- Extensible argument passing
